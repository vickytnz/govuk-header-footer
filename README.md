# A proposal for more Service Standard transparency by using the GOV.UK service footer


An idea to make services developed to the GOV.UK Service Standard have better transparency mechanisms (while also freeing up the space taken up by the phase banner and feedback link on current services).
## The footer

<img width="1000" alt="GOV.UK footer with standard links to Accessibility, Privacy, Terms and Conditions but with a new link to Open sourced code, a phase banner and 'This is a new service assessed to the Service Standard - view assessment history for this service'" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d44a7b06-4e89-4cce-9129-c0177d381fc1">

## The Service assessment history page
Forgive the incorrect formatting of the header, this is an Eleventy default
<img width="674" alt="Service assessments for service
UK government digital services started after 1 July 2019 must meet the Service Standard on GOV.UK if they: change a customer record, are built, not bought.

# A proposal for more Service Standard transparency by using the GOV.UK service footer


An idea to make services developed to the GOV.UK Service Standard have better transparency mechanisms (while also freeing up the space taken up by the phase banner and feedback link on current services).
## The footer

## The Service assessment history page
Forgive the incorrect formatting of the header, this is an Eleventy default

## Contributors

Thanks to:

* @joelanman for suggestion to make 'Feedback' more of an action - it is now 'Give feedback'
* Rosanna Fairthorne (via xgov-slack) for pressing down on the need for the history to flex for non-standard assurance. This will need workshopping as Rosanna suggested but as a first point I have renamed 'service assessments' to 'service assurance' - other comments about the framing of the Service Standard have also been included in the history page.
* @edwardhorsford to more explicitly separate user-facing and government-facing links - 'Give feedback' has remained on the first line as a user-facing action, whereas 'Source code' (was 'Open-sourced code') has moved down to the second line with the phase and 'Service assurance history'. I did try using the proper navigation components but it looked strange and I think would need hacking of the component.

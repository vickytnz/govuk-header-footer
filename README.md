# A proposal for more Service Standard transparency by using the GOV.UK service footer


An idea to make services developed to the GOV.UK Service Standard have better transparency mechanisms (while also freeing up the space taken up by the phase banner and feedback link on current services).

<img width="1000" alt="GOV.UK footer with standard links to Accessibility, Privacy, Terms and Conditions but with a new link to Open sourced code, a phase banner and 'This is a new service assessed to the Service Standard - view assessment history for this service'" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d44a7b06-4e89-4cce-9129-c0177d381fc1">
